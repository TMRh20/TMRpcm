/*
This library was intended to be a simple and user friendly wav audio player using standard
Arduino libraries, playing bare-bones standard format WAV files.

Many of the extra features have been added due to user request, and are enabled
optionally only to preserve the out of the box simplicity and performance initially
intended.

 See https://github.com/TMRh20/TMRpcm/wiki for info on usage

   Override the default size of the buffers (MAX 254). There are 2 buffers, so memory usage will be double this number
   Defaults to 64bytes for Uno etc. 254 for Mega etc. note: In multi mode there are 4 buffers*/

  /* HANDLE_TAGS - This options allows proper playback of WAV files with embedded metadata*/
//#define HANDLE_TAGS

  /*Ethernet shield support etc. The library outputs on both timer pins, 9 and 10 on Uno by default. Uncommenting this
    will disable output on the 2nd timer pin and should allow it to function with shields etc that use Uno pin 10 (TIMER1 COMPB).*/

	    With MODE2 on, stereo tracks will be played using 4 pins, for 2 speakers in complimentary mode
	  In MULTI dual track mode, MODE2 will use a second timer for the second track.
	    With MODE2 off, each track will use a separate pin, but the same timer
	                                                                           */
